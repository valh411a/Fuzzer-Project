# Cameron DeVaul's Fuzzer Project
## currently in process of formatting for part 2
### Setup Instructions:
1. Download the following files to a folder of choice:
    - fuzzer.py
    - options.py
    - custom_auth.py
    - custom_auth.json
### External Libraries:
- sys       *(for system argument requests)*
- requests  *(for handling http requests)*
- optparse  *(for creating and handling optional arguments)*
- json      *(for compartmentalized information handling)*
### Assignment notes:
- files are distributed so that I can add to them in future steps
- Output is coded as for how I interpreted it from the assignment
    - see [fuzzer.py](fuzzer.py), line 38-40 for said output code
- Referenced from a similarly designed Fuzzer project code
    - https://github.com/tofferrosen/Fuzzer
    - migrated code to mechanicalsoup implementation
    - modified output to make more sense in tune to the assignment
  
If you have any questions, feel free to email me.
